NoHo.

I'm writing a Ruby gem that provides a CLI for reading the Old Farmer's Almanac from a command line. Historic austerity for posterity! And beyond.

If I have any hope of completing the required blog for this project. I'd better start now. Not because I have a deadline, as a self-paced on-liner. It's because if I let one more day go by without getting started, I will lose the substance of this important moment. That moment when you've labored for a week over something kinda cute and functional and start to realize that your approach might not quite be what the project is calling for.
